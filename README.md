# Jet

### Simplified clone of the React    

Jet is a "recreated" React from the ground up.    
Main goal of Jet is a becoming of a good grasp of how React works, and when and why it calls the various lifecycle methods of a component.

> **disclaimer**  
> Jet is based on React 15.3, in particular using ReactDOM and the stack reconciler. React 16 and beyond have changed a lot. Jet gives a general sense of how diffing works.  
> But just keep in mind the implementation details are now quite out of date.
